# coding-challenge-charger-uptime-main
 
To run the code

```
python main.py input_1.txt
```

## Logic

I used logic to find min and max of each ChargerID and the total uptime 

Later i calculated percentage as follows:

Total time = Sum of (max - min) for all station.

Total Uptime = Sum of up time for each station.

```
percentage uptime = Total Uptime / Total time
```
